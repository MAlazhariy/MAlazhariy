## Al-Rahma Hospital

Al-Rahma Hospital mobile app is a multi-module Flutter application designed to elevate patient care and simplify the management of the hospital's corporate clients and their patients. It empowers users to book appointments, review medical records and test results, track vitals, and access telemedicine and emergency services.

- Took **ownership** at project kickoff by collaborating one-on-one with the manager to analyze requirements, made key UX decisions, and set the deadline; initiated a front-end-first strategy to leverage downtime‚Äî**saving costs, accelerating timeline, simplifying backend handovers.**
- Managed architecture and workflow, and provided ongoing post-launch support. 
- Designed the UI and built a high-fidelity Figma interactive prototype, and quickly mastered the tools.
- Parallel Frontend Development: created mock data to simulate backend behavior, and defined expected API schemas into a Postman collection during development; then gradually switched each completed module to live backend data with a one-line code change, which ensured a smooth handoff and progressive data integration.
- Acted as **team lead** by configuring a GitHub integration for immediate backend testing (avoiding deployment delays), performing **QA** on done features, participating in technical discussions, and building a Notion workflow to **track tasks**, log **bugs**, and **monitor progress**, which streamlined communication, reduced meeting time, and accelerated delivery.
- Designed and implemented a highly customized payment solution to address the lack of local credit gateways in Djibouti; coordinated closely with the backend developer to architect a flexible payment logic supporting wallet, cash, bank transfer, company insurance (partial/full), and receipt-based local payments; ensured minimal error risk for this critical feature.
- Implemented dynamic data presentation logic that filters available doctors, schedules, and services based on working hours, holidays, and visit type, tailored for low-tech users to ensure a smooth and intuitive UX.
- Implemented role-based access control solution, assigning tailored permissions to employees to access corporate accounts, billing, and patient data‚Äîseamlessly coordinated with backend services.
- Developed a CLI alias script for automatic feature scaffolding, boosting development productivity by over 50% and accelerating repetitive coding tasks.
- Developed a color system generation via a Python script, producing grayscales, tints, shades, and typographic palettes for consistent theming.

## Taxi Proche - Uber clone

Taxi Proche is a ride-hailing app for Djibouti, built on a CodeCanyon Uber clone. After vetting and selecting the optimal codebase, I dove into its complex structure to deliver major edits, refactor and migrate code, fix native issues, resolve bugs, and implement new features with continuous testing to ensure stability and alignment with business needs.

* Evaluated and selected optimal codebase after thorough analysis of available ride-hailing solutions, choosing the most efficient option.
* Resolved critical Google Maps API overconsumption issue that caused excessive billing; collaborated directly with Google Cloud support team to address the problem, implemented API usage optimization, and established debug mode restrictions to reduce unnecessary costs for the client.
* Secured Google Maps APIs by separating API responsibilities, implementing protection practices, and establishing better usage monitoring to prevent overconsumption.
* Reduced server load by enhancing driver location updates; transitioned from MQTT to Firebase real-time connection through close backend collaboration.
* Enhanced ride request distribution system by collaborating with a backend developer to implement an automated cron job solution, eliminating manual driver rejection requirements and enabling automatic request forwarding to the next available driver, significantly improving system efficiency.
* Developed advanced trip management features, including estimated pricing, trip cancellation, estimated arrival time calculation based on distance and driver speed, and VIP trip functionality with no destination requirement.
* Implemented deep code refactoring to eliminate tight coupling, reduce unnecessary server requests, and maintain clean code practices.
* Designed and implemented a custom server-driven localization system and converted it into a package later.
* Improved iOS user experience by implementing back-swipe navigation and dismissible keyboard functionality when tapping outside input fields.
* Merging codebase updates to the current project codebase using proper Git practices while maintaining custom features and client-specific modifications.
* Maintained and uploaded the web version to the server environment.

## Bul Ve Al

Classified AD application in Turkey.

- I was responsible for developing the application from scratch in addition to designing the application interface design and improving the user experience.
- Implementing a dynamic localization system according to the client's request, fetching language data and translations from the server, and this system was converted to a private package for easy use later in other projects.
It was a challenge, especially on the ad publishing page with multi-language, with the feature of automatically translating the rest of the uncompleted content by handling it with Google Translate services.

## [Internet State Manager Package (Open Source)](https://pub.dev/packages/internet_state_manager)

Flutter package designed to manage internet connection outages seamlessly within the app; ensures an uninterrupted UX by implementing a reliable data-fetching mechanism that activates once the internet connection is restored. This package allows developers to easily handle network changes and customize user interfaces based on connectivity status with easy code.
- Actual Internet Connection Check: Accurately detects the presence of an internet connection, beyond just verifying a Wi-Fi connection.
- Automatic Data Fetching: Implements your custom function, which is called once the internet connection is restored. This feature provides an excellent user experience as the user does not have to reload/open the application again to fetch data when the internet connection is down.
- Builder Widget: Provides a dedicated builder widget with parameters to display various internet connection statuses, allowing control over the display of specific widgets based on the connection state.
- Customizable Widgets: Displays the package's built-in widget or a custom widget when the internet connection is down, with periodic status updates when the connection is restored.
- Ease of Use: Simplifies implementation by reducing the need for extensive code on every page that requires internet connection checks, making it practical and user-friendly.
